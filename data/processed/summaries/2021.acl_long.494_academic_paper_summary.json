  "summary": "This paper proposes a Dual Graph Convolutional Networks (DualGCN) model for aspect-based sentiment analysis. The model integrates syntactic knowledge and semantic information through SynGCN and SemGCN modules, using orthogonal and differential regularizers to enhance the capture of semantic associations. Experimental results on three datasets show the DualGCN model's effectiveness and superiority over attention-based and syntax-based methods.",
