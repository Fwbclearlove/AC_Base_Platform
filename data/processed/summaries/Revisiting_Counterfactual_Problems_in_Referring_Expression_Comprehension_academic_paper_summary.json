  "summary": "This paper addresses the counterfactual referring expression comprehension problem, introducing a method for generating fine-grained counterfactual samples and a framework that enhances cross-modal feature learning with dual-branch attentive fusion and contrastive learning. The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance on public REC datasets and constructed C-REC datasets, contributing to the field of vision-language tasks.",
