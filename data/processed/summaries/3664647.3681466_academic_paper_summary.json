  "summary": "This paper introduces Harmony-VAE and an inverse harmonization model to enhance image harmonization. Harmony-VAE integrates composite images into the VAE decoding process, while the inverse harmonization model generates synthetic composite images for data augmentation. The proposed methods are evaluated on iHarmony4 and Human Harmony datasets, demonstrating improved performance in image harmonization tasks.",
