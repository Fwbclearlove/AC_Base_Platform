  "summary": "This paper proposes DualGCN, a model that integrates syntactic knowledge through SynGCN and semantic information through SemGCN for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. The model is shown to effectively handle complex and informal sentences, outperforming attention-based and syntax-based methods on multiple datasets.",
