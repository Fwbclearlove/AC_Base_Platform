  "summary": "This paper introduces a Bimodal Deep Architecture (BDA) for measuring similarity across image and text modalities. The BDA, which includes stacked RBMs and a variant autoencoder, achieves 88.96% accuracy in image annotation selection. It is flexible and can be extended to other modalities within complex systems.",
