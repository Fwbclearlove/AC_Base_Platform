  "summary": "This paper proposes an improved eavesdropping detection strategy in a two-step quantum direct communication protocol using an extended three-particle GHZ state. The strategy enhances the detection rate to 59% and is shown to be more secure through entropy analysis, providing a higher probability of detecting eavesdroppers and ensuring secure message transmission.",
