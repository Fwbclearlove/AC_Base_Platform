  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel tree-structured decoder, S2TD, for image paragraph captioning. It addresses the research problem of holistic organization and structural nature capturing in previous methods. S2TD includes a split module, a score module, and a word-level RNN, and uses a tree structure loss for end-to-end learning. Experimental results on the Stanford benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of S2TD in generating diverse and coherent paragraphs.",
