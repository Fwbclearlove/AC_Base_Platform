  "summary": "This paper introduces DualRel, a model for image paragraph captioning that captures spatial and semantic relations. It includes a relation embedding module and a relation-aware interaction module, outperforming strong baselines on the Stanford benchmark dataset. The model utilizes Faster R-CNN for object detection and employs weakly supervised learning for semantic relation classification. The experimental results show significant improvements in various evaluation metrics.",
