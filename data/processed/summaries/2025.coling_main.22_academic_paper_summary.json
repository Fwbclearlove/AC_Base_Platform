  "experimental_results": "CORSA model outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal methods on all metrics on Twitter-15 and Twitter-17 datasets.",
  "conclusions": "The CORSA framework effectively considers conditional multimodal relations between images and texts, improving MABSA performance, but there is room for improvement in annotation methods.",
