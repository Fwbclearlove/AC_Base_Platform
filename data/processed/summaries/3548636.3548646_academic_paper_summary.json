  "summary": "This paper introduces EP-BERTGCN, a method that combines pre-trained BERT and GCN for text-based power equipment fault recognition. It addresses the domain gap between electric power and general NLP and demonstrates superior performance over previous baselines. The method also includes domain adaptation of BERT for enhanced performance in the power field.",
