  "summary": "This paper introduces an Enhanced Multi-Channel Graph Convolutional Network (EMC-GCN) for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE). The EMC-GCN model defines ten relation types, incorporates linguistic features, and employs a refining strategy to improve triplet extraction. Experimental results show the model's effectiveness and robustness in ABSA tasks.",
