  "summary": "This paper presents a multi-modal learning approach for constructing hierarchical bimodal representations of image-tags for word tags alternative choice. The method involves three stages of representation learning and a data-specific strategy, achieving high accuracy on the private test set and demonstrating the importance of the choice strategy for moderate representations.",
