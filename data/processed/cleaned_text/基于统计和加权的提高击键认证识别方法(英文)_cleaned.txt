Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for improving the recognition accuracy of keystroke authentication through feature extraction of keystroke sequences. Outlier data is filtered, probabilities of each input key are calculated, and less informative features are selected. Weights are assigned, and a score for successful authentication is calculated. The use of a third-party dataset enhances objectivity and comparability. Experimental results show the proposed detector is more accurate than others.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many systems still use static password authentication due to its low cost and convenience. However, this is fragile when users are careless or passwords are weak. This paper aims to enhance login-password recognition accuracy using biometric characteristics, which are unique and cannot be stolen, lost, or forgotten. Various classifiers have been developed for Keystroke Dynamics-Based Authentication (KDA). This paper introduces the TOP10 detector and compares it with other methods.

II. METHODOLOGY

Section II describes the methodology to improve keystroke authentication recognition accuracy. Section III presents experiments and results, while Section IV discusses conclusions and further work.

III. PROCEDURE OF TOP10

3.1 Data collection
Keystroke dynamics analyze typing rhythms to discriminate among users. The password of n bits generates (2n - 1) keystroke eigenvalues, including latency and duration, forming a (2n - 1)-dimensional feature space. A benchmark dataset from 51 subjects typing a strong 10-character password is used.

3.2 Procedure
Step 1: Keystroke sequences are divided into vectors A_mn(pp) and A_mn(pr) for press and release times, respectively.
Step 2: Input data is assumed to follow a normal distribution. Outliers beyond three standard deviations are removed, and mean μ and standard deviation σ are calculated.
Step 3: Probability p(tk) for each element in the vector t is calculated using Eq. (3).

In the use of C++ programming with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, it is convenient to obtain the probability at a specific point in the test vector using the cumulative distribution function from the C++ Boost library. The probability, p(tk), is given by p(tk) = 2 × CDF(μk - ABS(μk - t)) (4), which avoids the complex process of quadrature. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculates a variable's probability of being less than or equal to a given value x, which is the integration of the probability density function from negative infinity to x.

We select the 10 minimum probability values from the previous step and denote them as (s1, s2, ..., s10), then weigh them in Step 5. The weighing process involves setting the weight factor as w = 1/n for a given vector (s1, s2, ..., sn), assuming the same occurrence probability in practice. The mean value and standard deviation of the vector are calculated using Eq. (5) and Eq. (6).

The mean (s̄) and standard deviation (σs) determine a normal distribution N(s, σ^2s). A new vector (p1, p2, ..., pn) is obtained by standardizing the given vector (s1, s2, ..., sn) using the mean and standard deviation in Eq. (7). The probabilities of pi in the normal distribution N(s, σ^2s) are calculated using Eq. (8) and named as the probability vector (q1, q2, ..., qn).

The weight vector (w1, w2, ..., wn) is obtained using the probabilities in Eq. (9). Finally, the score evaluating the user is obtained using Eq. (10), which depends on the input password score s for successful authentication.

For comparing the four detectors, a benchmark data set for keystroke dynamics is used, ensuring objectivity and convincing results. The training phase of the detector is conducted on timing vectors from genuine users, and the test phase is conducted on timing vectors from both genuine users and impostors. FRR (False Rejection Rate) and FAR (False Acceptance Rate) are calculated using Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), respectively.

The results of the four detectors, including EER (Equal Error Rate), FAR, FRR, and FAR + FRR, are presented in Table I. The performance of each detector is analyzed, with TOP10 showing the best improvement with an increase in the number of samples. The smallest sum of FAR and FRR is found for the detector proposed in this paper, indicating its efficiency compared to the other three detectors.

This paper presents a methodology that utilizes typing biometrics to enhance login-password authentication. The objective is to propose a good methodology and use a third-party benchmark data set for testing keystroke dynamics. Future work will focus on improving the efficiency of feature template depiction and updating the template for better keystroke familiarity and recognition accuracy.
