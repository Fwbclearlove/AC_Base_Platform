Abstract: In order to improve the recognition accu-
racy of keystroke authentication, a methodology
based on feature extraction of keystroke sequence
is presented in this paper. Firstly, the data of the
users' keystroke feature information that has too
much deviation with the mean deviation is filtered
out. Secondly, the probability of each input key is
calculated and 10 values which do not have the
best
features
are
selected.
Thirdly,
they
are
weighed and a score evaluating the extent to
which the user could be authenticated successfully
is calculated. The benefit of using a third-party da-
ta set is more objective and comparable. At last,
the experimental result shows that the detector in
this paper is more accurate than the other three.

I. INTRODUCTION
At present, many application systems and soft-
wares are still using a static password authentica-
tion technology in the login process because of its
low cost and convenience. However, this authenti-
cation is fragile when there is a careless user or a
weak password. The purpose of this paper is to
improve the login-password authentication recog-
nition accuracy using biometric characteristic. The
advantage is that biometric characteristics are u-
nique to each person and could not be stolen, lost
or forgotten.
In earlier keystroke dynamics-based systems,
many classifiers are used to achieve higher system
accuracy. Statistics [1-3], neural networks [4], fuzzy
logic [5], support vector machines [6], k-nearest
neighbor [7], and other classifiers [8 -17] have been
developed into Keystroke Dynamics-Based Au-
thentication (KDA) systems. In 2008, Kang et al.
[3] used artificial rhythms to improve the quality of
keystroke data. However, users in the system have
to remember the locations of the inserting pauses
in their password, which is not an innate typing
characteristic. In addition, Wahyudi Martono et al.
[6] discussed the design and development of key-
stroke pressure-based typing biometrics for indi-
vidual user's verification, but this method requires
specially modified keyboards which may not be
widely acceptable, as these keyboards may not be
common in practical use. Recently, Saurabh Singh
and Dr.K.V.Arya [7] proposed a new approach in
free text keystroke authentication based on key
classification, and get an encouraging result; how-
ever, this method is not compatible with our pass-
word authentication and other fixed text, such as
on-line banking system.
Detector in this paper is named as TOP10 and
comparisons between our method and the other
three proposed in Refs. [18-20] are made. Firstly,
comparisons on anomaly detection detector for
keystroke dynamics were made by Kevin S. Killou-
rhy and Roy A.Maxion [18], which includes 14
keystroke authentication detectors [3, 21-22]. As a
consequence, the performance of a detector named
Man _Scaled outperforms all the other detectors,
and its Equal Error Rate (EER) is 0.096. Moreover,
Yang Haiyan et al. [19] proposed a methodology
called Seq_Dist. It adopts a new representation for
the duration of tri-char for the user's input feature,
using the relative distance of user's keystroke
speed standing for its relative rhythm. At last, they

reach a recognition accuracy whose False Accep-
tation Rate (FAR) is 2.457% and False Rejection
Rate (FRR) is 0.05% . The Last detector is called
Diff_Sub, which is based on difference subspace
in Ref. [20]. It calculates the common feature vector
to depict a user's keystroke pattern according to
keystroke features of the user's several recent suc-
cessful authentications, and then utilizes the Euclid
distances between current keystroke pattern vec-
tors and common feature vectors to identify the
users. As a result, it obtains a result with FAR =
1.3% and FRR = 2% .
II. PAGE LAYOUT
This paper is organized as follows. Section II de-
scribes our methodology to improve the recogni-
tion accuracy of keystroke authentication. In Sec-
tion III, the experiments are presented and the re-
sults are discussed. Finally, conclusions and fur-
ther work are discussed in Section IV.
III. PROCEDURE OF TOP10
3.1 Data collection
Keystroke
dynamics,
the
analysis
of
typing
rhythms to discriminate among users, is based on
the hypothesis that different person would type in
different typing rhythm. In Ref. [21], these signifi-
cant patterns of different people typing in the same
phrase of text can be clearly visualized. In fact, the
difference is mainly manifested in keystroke dura-
tion and keystroke latency. Besides, Ref. [22] has
proved that utilizing two factors would be more ef-
fective than only using one of two, so both time
latency and time duration are extracted as key-
stroke feature in the paper.
The password of n bits contains ( 2n －1) key-
stroke eigenvalues, n of which is the number of
keystroke latency, and the other is the number of
keystroke intervals. Meanwhile, they also consti-
tute a vector of ( 2n －1) -dimensional feature
space. According to Ref. [23], the benchmark data
set was completed by 51 subjects (typists). Each
subject typed the same password 400 times over 8
sessions (50 repetitions per session). They waited
at least one day between sessions to capture some
of the day-to-day variation of each subject's typ-
ing. The password (.tie5Roanl) was chosen to be
the representative of a strong 10-character pass-
word.
3.2 The procedure
Step 1. The keystroke sequence is divided into two
vectors A
mn ( pp) and Amn ( pr) , where Amn ( pp)
stands for the elapsed time of a key from down to
up, while Amn( pr) means the interval of the down
time of two successive keys, so this value may be
negative in some cases.
Step 2. According to the hypothesis of Bleha
Saleh [24] and Leggett [5], the user 's input time da-
ta satisfies the normal distribution. So m vectors
collected from a user 's input are organized as a
sample matrix Amn=［α1, α2, …, αm］T, in which αi
is an n-dimensional row vector, then the mean val-
ue
μk and standard deviation σk for each column
can be calculated as follows,
μk = 1
m∑
m
i = 1 αik; k ∈( 1,n)
(1)
σk =
1
m - 1∑
m
i = 1 (αik - μk)
槡
2
(2)
According to the meaning of the normal distri-
bution curve, the area covered by the normal prob-
ability distribution is 0.997 4.
Then, Δ = αik －μk for each element αik is calcu-
lated. If
Δ >3σk, then αik should be removed from
the vector
αi and replaced by μk. This process will
be repeated until no element satisfies Δ > 3σk. Fi-
nally
μk and σk are denoted as μ and σ separately.
This method could filter out those inputs which
vary greatly with the usual keystroke for each user,
namely, to achieve the purpose of reducing the
possibility of misleading by those data.
Step 3. For the given vector t = ( t1, t2, …, tn) ,
the probability of t
k∈( t1, t2, …, tn) could be ob-
tained by Eq. (3).

However, in the use of C++ programming by Mi-
crosoft Visual Studio 2005 development platform, it is
more convenient to get the probability at a specific
point in the test vector by the cumulative distribution
function in C ++Boost library as follows,
p(tk) = 2 × CDF(μk －ABS(μk －t))
(4)
Using the method can avoid the complicated
process of quadrature. In Eq. (4), ABS (absolute)
means obtaining the absolute value, and Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) calculates a variable's
probability that its value is less than or equal to
variable value x, which is also the integration of the
probability density function from -! to the value x.
Step 4. We Select the 10 minimum probability val-
ues obtained from Step 3 and denote them as
( s1，
s
2，…，s10) , and then weigh them at Step 5.
Step 5. The procedure of weighing is as follows:
1) For a given vector( s1，s2，…，sn) (set n =10), its
(
weight factor should be set as w =
1
n , 1
n , …,
)

n
for their same occurrence probability in practical envi-
ronment. So the mean value and standard deviation
of the above vector can be calculated by Eq. (5) and
Eq. (6) separately.

Consequently, the mean s

viation

N(s,

s ).
2) Get a new vector( p1, p2, …, pn) by making stand-
ardization utilizing the mean s
— and standard deviation
σs in Eq. (7) for the given vector( s1，s2，…，sn) .
pi = 1

3) Obtain the probability of pi∈( p1, p2, …, pn) in
the normal distribution N ( s，σ

the probability vector as( q1, q2, …, qn) .
q(pi | s,σs) =

4) Using the above( q1, q2, …, qn) , get a weight
vector( w1, w2, …, wn) as follows.

(9)
Step 6. In the end, it is easy to obtain the score
evaluating the user by using Eq. (10). Whether the
user could be authenticated successfully or not
depends on the score s of her/his input password.

IV. COMPARING THE FOUR DETECTORS
4.1 Method of using the benchmark data set
During the process of comparing the four detectors, a
benchmark data set for keystroke dynamics supported
by Kevin Killourhy and Roy Maxion [23] is used, which
is a supplement to Ref. [18]. Using a third-party data to
compare the various detectors is more objective and
the results will be more convincing.
It is started by designating one of our 51 sub-
jects as the genuine user, and the rest as impos-
tors. Next, recognizing the genuine user and im-
postors by training an anomaly detector and tes-
ting its ability as follows.
1) Firstly, the training phase of the detector on
the timing vectors from the num = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 35, 40 and 45 password repetitions typed by the
genuine user are ran, where num denotes the num-
ber of samples used in experiments below. So the
detector builds a model template of the user's typ-
ing behavior.
2) Then, we conduct the test phase of the de-
tector on the timing vectors from the remaining 45,
40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 repetitions typed by
the genuine user. Record the anomaly scores as-
signed to each timing vector as user scores, name-
ly FRR. Taking 40 as an example, it will produce 8
× 40 =320 records.
3) Finally, we conduct the test phase of the de-
tector on the timing vectors from all the repetitions
typed by the other 50 impostors. Then record the
anomaly scores assigned to each timing vector as
38
CLOUD SECURITY AND RISK PREVENTION
2012.7
impostor scores, namely FAR. The number of at-
tacks record is the same for each user, and the val-
ue is 50 × 8 × 50 = 20 400.
Repeat this process and designate each of the
other subjects as the genuine user in turn. Still tak-
ing 40 as an example, a totality of 16 320 sets of
user (51 × 8 × 40) and 1 020 000 sets of impostor
(51 × 50 × 8 × 50) could be obtained after the train-
ing and testing of each detector.
In a real login process for any authentication
system, it is impractical to input his password as
many as 200 times for a user in order to implement
complex algorithms in building a template. As a re-
sult, the template is generated by trying to increase
the user's input times of password of various test-
ed detectors.
4.2 Comparison result
All the scores of each detector are imported into
database, and then FRR and FAR are calculated by
Eq. (11) and Eq. (12) separately, in which A de-
notes the acceptance times of impostor, D means
denial times of genuine user, and T is for total rep
-
etitions of genuine user.
FRR = D
T
(11)
FAR = A
T
(12)
Ideally, the values of FRR and FAR should be
as low as possible. However, reducing the FRR
value is supposed to increase the success chances
of the attacker, while blindly decreasing FAR will
lead to higher denial of legitimate users because of
strict identification standards in turn. Therefore,
both FRR and FAR should be adjusted according
to actual requirements. In addition, EER is a point
where FRR equals to FAR, so the lower the EER is,
the more accurate the detector is.
Also taking num = 45 as an example, the values
of EER, FAR, FRR, FAR + FRR of four detectors
are shown in Table I.
The following four graphs show the values of EER，
FAR，FRR and FAR + FRR of each detector when the
num= 5, 10, 15, 20,25,30,35,40 and 45. Moreover, as for
the fitting curve of FAR and FRR of Seq_Dist, there is
no discrete point at the intersection, so its EER does
not exist in Table I and Figure 3.
From the four graphs in Figures 1 ~ 4, we can
see that the authentication accuracy of each detec-
tor continues to improve with the increase of the
number of samples, especially TOP10, which has

a better performance than the other three. In addi-
tion, the recognition accuracy of Man_Scaled and
the Diff_Sub does not improve significantly after
num =20. Meanwhile, the performance of Seq_Dist
has been relatively stable, that is because the de-
tector of Seq_Dist extracts the relative distance as
a characteristic value. As the user's familiarity to
the keystroke is improved, changes in various keys
will also remain relatively stable.
Finally, we conclude that the smallest value of
the sum of FAR and FRR of the detector in this
paper is 0.141 4, Man_Scaled is 0.217 4, Seq_Dist is
0.606 7 and Diff_Sub is 0.629 6. So the experimental
result shows that the detector in this paper is more
efficient than the other three.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented a methodology that utilized
the typing biometrics features to improve the usual
login-password authentication. Some experiments
were conducted and the better performance was a-
chieved by using a statistical classifier which com-
bined the statistics and the weighted method. The
objective in this work is not only to propose a
good methodology, but also to utilize a third-party
benchmark data set as the testing standard for
keystroke dynamics, which means our evaluation
methodology could be used by the community to
assess new detectors and obtain comparative re-
sults. It is because the user's keystroke data plays
a crucial role in detection accuracy of various key-
stroke detectors.
In the further work, in order to improve the ac-
curacy of keystroke authentication recognition, our
research work will focus on how to depict the
user's feature template in a more efficient way. The
future work may also include the update of the fea-
ture template so as to improve the user's familiarity
of keystroke.
