Abstract—Clothing images are abundant especially from the e-
commercial platform, due to the rapid development of e-business.
Recognizing and retrieving those images is of importance for
commercial and social applications, which has recently been
received tremendous attention from multimedia processing and
computer vision. However, the large variations in clothing of their
appearance and style, and even the large quantity of multiple
categories and attributes make those problems challenging. Fur-
thermore, the labels provided by shop retailers for real world
images are largely erroneous or incomplete. Even worse, the
imbalance problem among those image categories prevents the
effective learning. To overcome those problems, we adopt a multi-
task deep learning framework to learn effective representation.
And we propose multi-weight convolutional neural networks for
imbalance learning. The topology of this network is composed
of two kinds of layers, shared layers at the bottom and task
dependent ones at the top. Furthermore, category-relevant pa-
rameters are incorporated to regularize the learning procedure
of backward gradients for different categories. We collect a large-
scale dataset for those two problems containing about one million
shop photos from four different Chinese retailers. Experiments
on this dataset demonstrate that our proposed joint framework
and multi-weight neural networks can effectively learn robust
representation and achieve better performance.
Keywords—Clothing Image recognition; Convolutional neural
network; Multi-task; Multi-weight
I. INTRODUCTION
Abundant clothing images are available in electronic com-
mercial platform, such as taobao.com in China and ama-
zon.com in USA. Scores of commercial and social applications
are potentially related to recognizing and retrieving those im-
ages from webpages [1]–[6]. For example, a woman would like
to automatically annotate her travel photo with the recognized
clothing type and some attributes and then share with her
relatives and friends. Another example, in a clothing image
retrieval system effective classifying these clothing images and
detecting their attributes are indispensable functionalities. And
this intelligent search engine behind must learn a compact and
effective representation to perform efﬁcient retrieval and show
satisfactory results.
With the the increasingly business values of fashion and
shopping industry, automatic clothing image analysis has re-
ceived tremendous attention. Learning robust representations
for images is the key to perform effective retrievals. However,
to label all those images are almost impossible by human
beings. Automatic creating the labels using the available
textual information around inevitably gives rise to the noisy
labels. Here the noisy means that some labels are incorrect
and some are missing. The signiﬁcant difference between the
actual shop labels and the expected ones makes learning an
effective representation even more difﬁcult. Considering that
this phenomenon pervasively exists in web clothing image
data, how to cope with that is an unavoidable problem. This
is the motivation of our paper to build our model. Another
phenomenon within those large-scale web clothing images is
the imbalance among categories. And this will be illustrated
in detail in Section IV-A. Due to the extremely imbalance
among categories within the large volume of clothing image
data, training such a deep neural model is also challenging.
That is to say, how to train a neural network with large-scale
data under the extreme imbalance among categories should be
dealt with. This is the motivation of our paper to propose our
multi-weight neural networks.
In this paper, we focus on robust modeling the multiple
source relationship among real world large-scale images and
their automatically generated unreliable and incomplete la-
bels, such that robust representations could be learned for
effective retrieval. Unlike the traditional image classiﬁcation
and attributes detection, our task is performed in a strictly
controlled dataset with nearly correct labels. To this end, we
should deal with two challenging questions for this task. The
ﬁrst problem is that the labels provided from the shop retailers
are, to a large extent, erroneous or incomplete. This causes it
difﬁcult to capture the relationship between clothing images
and their vulnerable labels. The second problem is that those
large quantities of clothing categories and attributes are in
an extreme imbalance. This makes it difﬁcult to perform an
effective model learning.
To tackle those problems, we take a data-driven approach
and propose multi-weight neural networks to retrieving cloth-
ing images in real world. In this multi-weight CNNs, some
closely related categories and their attributes are grouped
together as a single task and all those tasks share a common
representation. Furthermore, the weight adaptation is incor-
porated to regularize the backward gradients in the learning
algorithm from different categories, in order to deal with
the imbalance problem resulted from different categories of

clothing images. To evaluate our multi-weight CNNs, we
collect a large, complex, and real-world collection of clothing
image dataset, e-Clothing1.4M. We then compare the proposed
multi-weight CNNs on this e-Clothing1.4M with another two
methods. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our multi-
weight networks performs best among those methods. And the
proposed multi-weight can effectively deal with the erroneous
and incomplete labels and data imbalance problems in large-
scale real world clothing images.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
ﬁrstly review related work in Section II. We introduce the
details of our multi-weight neural nets, the architecture and
its learning algorithm, are described in Section III. Section
IV describes the experimental dataset, e-Clothing1.4M. The
experimental results are then given and discussed. Finally,
Section V draws the conclusion and shows some future work.
II. RELATED WORK
With the increasingly large business value of shopping in-
dustry, automatic clothing image analysis has received tremen-
dous attention. Signiﬁcantly, one trend is to use attribute learn-
ing to give more much ﬁne-grained description for clothing
image, which has been widely explored in computer vision
community [7]–[14]. However, one of the major challenges
faced with attribute learning is lack of well-labeled training
data because of the heavy cost of human laboring. Besides,
obtaining these attributes usually require some domain-speciﬁc
knowledge, which can then be applied for labeling the data.
To overcome this difﬁculty, Berg et al. [10] propose to auto-
matically obtain attributes and visual appearance by mining
the descriptive text of images from webpages. For clothing
images, Chen et al. [9] focus on learning visually attributes of
clothing on the human upper body only. Recently, Shankar
et al. [12] propose to discover all attributes present in an
image, in a weakly supervised scenario, based on deep neural
networks. Generally speaking, those research works only take
attribute learning as a single task. However, when dealing with
large-scale clothing images, the attributes are highly-related
with the clothing category and those categories cannot be
ignored during attributes discovering.
Analyzing clothing images, from another perspective, is
based on methods from pose estimation and person detection
[15]–[19]. Intuitively, human recognition is related to clothing
image recognition. Therefore, human recognition motivated
clothing image analyzing is interesting. Clothing parsing is to
predict a semantic category, such as shirt, skirt, and shoes, for
each pixel in an image. The parsing results then could be fur-
ther used for clothing recognition. Most notably, Liu et al. [15]
address the cross-scenario problem that a daily human photo
is performed to retrieval a clothing shop photo. They alleviate
the discrepancy of those two distributions through a sparsely
coded transfer matrix. Kalantidis et al. [17] also consider a
similar cross-scenario approach, where they start from pose
estimation and then utilize clothing parsing. Yamaguchi et al.
[18] recently propose an unconstrained clothing parsing with-
out user-provided tag information for clothing retrieval. The
insight obtained from those methods is the use of body pose
estimation for clothing parsing. However, the performance of
those approaches largely rely on an accurate pose estimation
and human parts detection, and cannot easily extend to a large-
scale clothing parsing and recognition system.
From the year of 2006 [20], deep learning motivated by
the biological distributed structure of human brain is proposed
to learn hierarchical and effective representations to facilitate
various computer vision tasks. The basic idea of deep learning
methods is to use some simple non-linear neural neurons
to compositionally build a complex ﬁtting function. Deep
learning methods especially supervised convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) [21]–[23] and unsupervised autoencoders
and restricted Boltzmann machines, has successfully been
applied due to the availability of computational power and
the volume of data in large-scale image classiﬁcation [21] and
cross-modal retrieval applications [24]. Notably, deep learning
also has an advantage for multi-task learning, which aims
to achieve better performance by simultaneously exploring
multiple closely related tasks. Deep learning methods learn
hierarchical representations which capture those underlying
factors. Because of the natural connection, multi-task learn-
ing could then be a possible means for large-scale clothing
image analysis. Very recently, several methods based on deep
learning for multi-task learning have been proposed [25]–
[28]. Notably, Zhang et al. [25] propose to combine part-
based models and CNNs for feature representation in order
to obtain an attribute description for human under the multi-
task framework. However, this proposed framework is specif-
ically designed for small-scale datasets and cannot easily be
extended to large-scale problems. Bai et al. [26] propose a
multi-task deep networks for text-based image retrieval. In
this framework, query-sharing layers for image representation
and query-speciﬁc layers for relevance estimation are learned
jointly. In general, the representative power of CNNs com-
pared with shallow hand-crafted visual features, such as HoG
and SIFT, shades light on learning multiple tasks possible.
However, the performance of those partly fully-connected
neural networks heavily rely on qualities of data labels. Besids,
those CNN-based methods ignore the correlation between
attributes and neither the cross category of visual attributes
especially for large-scale clothing dataset.

Speciﬁcally, a patch in one image of 4 × 4 is convoluted
with a kernel of 2 × 2. And by moving the patch window the
convoluted result image of 3 × 3 are obtained. Evidently, the
multi-weight CNN is composed of two groups of layers: task
independent layers and task dependent layers. And the weights
to be learned in task independent layers are denoted as Wc,
while the weights to be learned of task dependent layers are

denoted as Wt. In addition, we introduce a group of hyper-
parameters γt to balance the losses incurred from different
categories. To make it clear, we denote the mapping of task
independent layers as φc(·) and that of a speciﬁc task layers as
φt(·). Then, for a mini-batch of images Ib the representation oc
of task independent is obtained as φc(Ib; Wc), and the output
of a speciﬁc task t is obtained as φt(oc; Wt). Thus, under
the supervised learning framework, learning this multi-weight
network parameters can be cast into an optimization problem.
For a speciﬁc task t, the output layer takes on the multi-
label structure. Here, the multi-label treats each label equally.
It is straight-forward that the loss in tth task is taken as a
sigmoid cross-entropy function. Each image Ij is expected
to have a vector of label probability pj, having length Mt.
Note that the different length Mt comes from the number
of labels in tasks. With the sigmoid cross-entropy loss, the
network parameter Θt = {Wc, Wt} is learned by minimizing
the following objective function,

in which, the sigmoid cross-entropy loss ℓbm takes the form

where the probability vector ˆpb is obtained by applying the
sigmoid function to each of the Mt outputs of layer L8 on the

IV. EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate the proposed multi-weight CNNs with the other
two deep networks, multi-label CNNs and multi-task ones.
All our experiments are performed on our e-Clothing1.4M
real-world dataset. We ﬁrst describe the dataset collected.
Next, we introduce the evaluation criteria adopted in our
experiments. Thereafter, the settings of those methods are
given. And a simple but effective method for setting the weight
are proposed. At last, the performance of deep neural models
are reported followed by an analysis on our deep models.
A. Dataset
We collect a new dataset, called e-Clothing1.4M, to evaluate
our proposed methods. To the best of our knowledge there is
no available real-world dataset for our tasks. Speciﬁcally, a
large number of pairs of images and their description words
contained within webpages are crawled down from four widely
used e-commercial platforms, including JD.com, taobao.com,
meilishuo.com, and mugujie.com. By performing word seg-
mentation, choosing high frequency words of description
words, and checking by human, we design a clothing catalog
with types and attributes. To sum up, we obtain 830 keywords
and 24 groups for clothing types and attributes. Furthermore,
through data cleaning we obtain 1,462,438 pairs of images
and their labels of types and attributes. For evaluation, we

randomly divide the e-Clothing1.4M dataset into the training
dataset and the test one. And 1,069,901 images of 350,000
products are set for training; 392,537 images are set for test
while keeping the quantity of each group of labels in balance.
Statistics on the amount of data in 24 categories shows the
extremely imbalance, as shown at the left column in Table
II. Evidently, the foremost category is the common attribute
’Color’ with the maximum proportion one. The aftermost is
miscellaneous attribute ’Wool Thickness’ with the proportion
0.0002. Intuitively, images in this e-Clothing1.4M dataset are
distributed as a heavy-tail distribution. To summarize, statistics
of this dataset is given in Table I.
B. Evaluation Criteria
In this section, we describe our metrics used in our experi-
ments. The mAP measures the discrimination and stability of
those learning algorithms. Speciﬁcally, given one query and
the ﬁrst R top-ranked retrieved data, the average precision is
deﬁned as follows,
mAP ≜1
M
R

r=1
p(r) · rel(r)
(10)
where M is the number of relevant data in the retrieved result,
p(r) is the precision at r, and rel(r) presents the relevance
of a given rank (one if relevant and zero otherwise). The
retrieved data is considered as relevant if it has the same
semantic label as the query. Then, the mAP score is obtained
by averaging AP of all the queries. In order to use the metric
mAP, we build an image retrieval system based on the learned
representation. In this system, the dataset under consideration
is used both as the query set and as the candidate set. And
for each task, if a query and a retrieved result has common
labels, then the relevance is set to one. We then compute the
mAP score for each individual task. In all our experiments
we report the results with mAP@50 (R = 50).
C. Methods and Settings
We ﬁrstly compare multi-weight CNNs with two meth-
ods, multi-label CNNs and multi-task CNNs on our e-
Clothing1.4M dataset. Furthermore, the other interesting ex-
periments are performed on two categories data with an
intentionally designed ratio. Practically, our three kinds of
CNNs implementations largely depends on the Caffe deep
learning framework [29]. And the prominent AlexNet CNN
architecture [21] is adopted. All our experiments are conducted
on a workstation with an NVIDIA K20c GPU card, dual E5-
2650 CPUs with 2.00 GHz, and 64 GB main memory. As
a preprocessing step, the size of images is resized to 256 ×
256 with RGB three channels, i.e. 256 × 256 × 3. Then the
resized image is fed into the AlexNet network. Subsequently,
the network will randomly crop the image with a size of 224
× 224. Namely, an image with 224 × 224 × 3 is received.
Through the pre-processing, the size of input layers of all
three methods are set as 196,608. In terms of the original
AlexNet, the sizes of subsequent layers are set the same as
those in AlexNet, i.e. 253,440 →186,624 →64,896 →64,896
→43,264 →4096 →4096 from L1 to L7. The output layer
is then conﬁgured to 830 sigmoid neurons according to the
categories and attributes. The ﬁrst convolutional layer ﬁlters
input images with 96 kernels of size 11×11×3 with a stride of
4 pixels. The second convolutional layer takes as input from
the output of the ﬁrst convolutional layer and ﬁlters it with
256 kernels of size 5×5×48. Subsequently, the third, fourth,
and ﬁfth convolutional layers are concatenated to each other
without any pooling layers. The third convolutional layer has
384 kernels of size 3×3×256 connected to the outputs of the
second convolutional layer. The fourth convolutional layer has
384 kernels of size 3×3×192, and the ﬁfth convolutional layer
has 256 kernels of the same size of fourth layer. The fully-
connected layers have 4,096 neurons. Besides, we use dropout
trick in the ﬁrst two fully-connected layers by setting to zero
the output of each hidden neuron in those two layers with a
probability 0.5. And the Regularized Linear Unit (ReLU) non-
linearity neuron is adopted to the output of convolutional and
fully-connected layer. For the multi-weight CNN, we set the
task dependent parameter γt as the amount proportion of the
tth task. This proportion has been shown in Table II.
Here we make clear the main novelties of multi-weight
CNNs compared with multi-label CNNs and multi-task CNNs.
The basic idea of this multi-label CNNs is to treat each label
equally. Speciﬁcally, the number of output neurons of this
multi-label network is set as the total number of categories and
attributes. And each output neuron is conﬁgured as a sigmoid
function. For the multi-task CNNs, the idea is to learn multiple
related problems together at the same time. In this paper,
recognizing clothing images and detecting their attributes are
treated in the framework of multi-task. Lastly, multi-weight
CNNs treat each category and its related attributes in one
group, making use of the ﬁne-grained relationship among
them. Meanwhile, multi-weight CNNs consider the imbalance
among those groups of categories.
D. Experimental Results
The experimental results on the eClothing1.4M dataset are
summarized in Table II. All numerical values in those two
Table are mAP scores. At the left most column in Table
II, the category names are orderly shown according to their
own normalized proportion. That is, the ”Color” which has
the maximum quantity images is shown at the top. On the
contrary, ”Wool Thickness” is shown at the bottom. Then,
the results of three CNN-based methods, multi-label, multi-

841
task, and multi-weight, with their number of iterations are
shown at the subsequent columns, respectively. The mAP
value in boldface standards for the best performance achieved
from those three methods. In all 24 categories, the multi-
label CNNs performs the best within seven categories. The
multi-task CNNs achieves the best within ﬁve categories. And
the multi-weight CNNs show the best performance within the
other twelve categories. In general, those three CNN-based
method averaging over those 24 categories have the mAP
values: 52.48% for multi-label, 53.11% for multi-task, and
55.23% for multi-weight. Clearly, multi-weight CNNs show
the best performance compared with the other two methods.
Note that for small proportion, such as ”Waist”, ”Feather”,
and ”Sleeve”, have gained some improvement. Also note that
in Table II the ﬁve categories, ”Dense”, ”Leather”, ”Cardi-
gan”, ”Cheongsam”, and ”Wool Thickness” achieve the best
performance compared with multi-label CNNs and multi-
weight ones. Those ﬁve categories have very low proportions
compared with the maximum ratio category ”Color”. Those
demonstrate that multi-weight CNN is an suitable method
for our clothing recognition and attribute detection task. And
appropriate weight proportion could improve the experimental
results. Therefore, using the multi-weight CNNs could, to
some extent, deal with the imbalance problem and noisy labels
in real world clothing dataset.
We intentionally design the ratio to show the effectiveness
of regularize weights of categories in multi-weight CNN.
Table IV and Table V shows mAP scores for independent
”Coat” and ”Pantsuit” vs. dependent ”Length of Sleeve” and
”Sleeve” categories with the quantity ratio 10:1. The mAP
in boldface denotes the best performance among those three
methods. Those two groups have similar results when using
multi-weight CNN networks, irrespective of the dependency
relationship between categories. Speciﬁcally, for the category
of independent group with smaller ratio ”Pantsuit”, the multi-
weight achieve the best performance. For the category of
dependent group with smaller ratio ”Sleeve”, the multi-weight
also achieve the best performance. This demonstrates that
for the category with smaller ratio the mAP score improves
using multi-weight CNNs compared with the other two CNN-
based methods. Therefore, when dealing with the data with the
category imbalance, multi-weight CNNs could learn better rep-
resentations, which is beneﬁted from the common information
contained within those kinds of data.
E. Setting Weights
Evidently, how to set the weights in our multi-weight
neural networks is of importance for imbalance learning. In
the original proposed solution, we set the weights according
to the ratio of the numbers of all categories. However, this
strategy would excessively boosts the values for small sample
categories. Therefore, to alleviate this effect, we propose a
smoothing function as follows,
wn =

rn
if rn ≥ravg/c,
ravg/c
if rn ≤ravg/c,
(11)
in which, the ratio rn is the number of samples in nth category
compared to the maximum of samples among categories.
And the ravg is the mean ratio among all categories. The
hyper-parameter c is set as 3.0 here. The tuition behind that
smoothing function is that for categories with smaller ratios
we increase their ratios to suitable ones and keep the larger
ratios unchanged. That regularization strategy would result
in effective learning. In our previous experiments, the value
of the average ratio ravg/c is set to 0.11. In effect, those
tasks with ratios lower than 0.11 (the maximum ratio is 1.0
for ”Color”) are regularized. We use those new weights and
obtain the following results, shown in Table III. Evidently, the
new setting weights strategy outperforms the other methods
in nearly all categories. And it indeed shows superior to the
previous method for weights setting. To better visualize the
performance of all those methods, we show the histograms of
the mAPs for all 24 categories in Figure 2.
V. CONCLUSION
Recognizing and retrieving the real-world large-scale cloth-
ing images is crucial for e-commercial and social applications.
In this paper, we propose a multi-weight convolutional neural
networks to deal with the noisy and imbalanced clothing
images. Our multi-weight CNN comprises of common layers
and task dependent layers with category-relevant parameters.
We collect a large-scale dataset containing about one million
shop photos from four different Chinese retailers. Experiments
on this dataset show the effectiveness of our multi-weight
neural networks. We still have some interesting problems to
investigate for our future work. We can extend this network
by introducing other convolutional networks to improve the
performance. Besides, we would like to investigate the weights
impacting on the network convergence.
